/**
 * What keeps lobby chat private, and what makes it arrive.
 *
 * #801 answered the first question by taking the message text off the
 * broadcast: the topic was `lobby:{code}` with a four-digit code, so anyone
 * enumerating names could read every conversation. #845 answered it properly by
 * renaming the topic to carry a per-lobby secret, and #852 showed why the
 * interim answer could not stay — it made delivery depend on a Redis that is
 * allowed to not exist, and in production does not, so nobody but the sender
 * ever saw a message.
 *
 * The privacy guarantee now lives in the topic name. These assertions guard the
 * two halves that remain: nothing broadcasts an email address as a display
 * name, and no code path composes the old guessable topic.
