Playwright starts `next dev` on **port 3100** by itself — 3000 is often taken by
another project, and `reuseExistingServer` will happily hand the suite whatever
is already answering there.

## Why these exist

The Jest suite mocks Supabase. That is right for 1148 unit tests, and it means
they cannot see the one thing that actually breaks a lobby: a client subscribed
to a different realtime topic than the server broadcasts to, or a message whose
body never arrives. Neither raises an error anywhere — the lobby just goes
quiet.

Three tests, each standing in for a check that used to be done by hand:

| Test | Replaces |
|---|---|
| `realtime-chat.spec.ts` — a message written in one browser arrives in another | opening two windows and typing into both (#801, #845) |
| `realtime-chat.spec.ts` — every player can resolve the topic, nobody else can | — |
| `realtime-chat.spec.ts` — a message is still there after a reload | checking chat history survives (#854) |
| `spectator.spec.ts` — a spectator sees the game start without reloading | watching a lobby you are not playing in (#845, #862) |
| `spectator.spec.ts` — a lobby with spectators disabled gives out no topic | — |
| `alias-three-players.spec.ts` — three teams of one, one describer and two guessers | playing a three-handed Alias round (#847) |

These found #852, both halves of #854, and #862 — where the test written to guard #845 showed that #845 had broken spectating an hour after shipping.

## How they are built

**Setup goes through the API, assertions go through the browser.** Lobbies and
players are created over HTTP because the entry and lobby-creation screens carry
almost no test ids, and driving them would make every test fragile in a way that
has nothing to do with what is being tested. A guest identity is three
localStorage keys, so each player gets its own browser context seeded with them
— two tabs in one context would share storage and be the same person.

**Waiting is on the WebSocket, not on a timer.** Realtime broadcast has no
replay, so a message sent before both sides have joined is simply lost.
`watchRealtimeSubscription` waits for Phoenix to acknowledge the join, which is
also the direct evidence that the client subscribed to `lobby:{code}:{secret}`
rather than the guessable bare name.

## They talk to the real database

Supabase Realtime is the thing under test, so a local Postgres would remove the
only reason these tests exist. Consequences:

- They need `.env.local` and **cannot run in CI**, which has no secrets.
- Every lobby they create is named `E2E — …` and the global teardown deletes it.
  Games and players cascade; the `LobbyParticipations` rows and the `E2E…`
  guests do not, so the teardown deletes those too (#867). The guests cached
  in `e2e/.auth` are kept for the next run.
- Guest identities are cached per role in `e2e/.auth/` (gitignored) and reused,
  because `/api/auth/guest-session` allows five requests per fifteen minutes.
  Tokens last 12h. This matters most against a deployment: there the limiter
  keys on the runner's real IP, which the per-test clearing deliberately will
  not touch, so minting a guest per run made the spectator tests unrunnable
  after a couple of attempts. Reuse is safe because a cached guest is never
  added to a lobby as a player.
- **Import `test` from `./support/fixtures`, not from `@playwright/test`.** That
  fixture clears this machine's rate-limit counters before **each** test. Since
  #854 the counters are shared in Redis, so the suite competes with itself: the
  auth preset allows five requests per fifteen minutes and every spectator needs
  a guest of their own, which a full run exhausts partway through. Clearing once
  per run was not enough. Only `::1`, `127.0.0.1` and `unknown` keys are touched
  — behind Vercel the limiter always keys on a real address, so this cannot
  reach anybody else's counters.
- Spectating needs `allowSpectators`, which is Premium, so `enableSpectators()`
  sets it in the database. What is under test is the spectator path, not the
  paywall.

## If a change to `lib/` seems to have no effect

Playwright reuses a dev server that is already listening on 3100. Next's dev
server hot-reloads most things but keeps module-level state — the memoised Redis
client, for one — so a change to how a client is constructed needs the server
restarted: `lsof -ti:3100 | xargs kill -9`. This cost half an hour once already.

## Against a deployment

`E2E_BASE_URL` skips the local dev server and points the same tests at a
released app — which is the release check, rather than curling for a 200.

The rate limits are real there and cannot be cleared: the limiter keys on the
runner's public IP, and the per-test clearing only ever touches loopback. Lobby
creation allows ten per hour against a bucket that resets on the hour, and the
suite makes six. **So: one production run per hour.** Guest identities are
cached, so repeat runs no longer spend the tighter five-per-fifteen-minutes
auth budget.
