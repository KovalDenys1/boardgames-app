/**

 * game state (move-processing, bot-turn, lobby poll). Previously each route
 * hand-rolled its own `gameType === 'x' ? sanitizeX() : ...` ternary, and
 * they'd already drifted: the bot-turn route was missing the guess_the_spy
 * branch entirely (harmless today since Spy has no bot support, but a
 * landmine for the next bot-enabled sanitized game type).
 *
 * `viewerUserId` is only meaningful for sanitizers that keep a viewer's own
 * not-yet-revealed data visible to themselves; pass `null` for a shared
 * broadcast payload with no single viewer, which redacts for everyone.
