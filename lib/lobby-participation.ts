 * Guest users are hard-deleted after three days of inactivity and

 * destroyed and the usable analytics window was four days (#816). This table
 * has no relation to `Users`, so the purge cannot reach it.
 *
 * Written on join rather than on game start, because 28% of lobbies never start
 * and "how many people were sitting in one" is exactly the question that could
 * not be answered.
