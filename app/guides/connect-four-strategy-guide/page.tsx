          <p className="mb-4 text-sm leading-relaxed" style={{ color: 'var(--bd-ink-soft)' }}>
            The board has 7 columns. Column 4 — the middle one — is the most valuable square on the board. A disc placed there can be part of more winning lines than any other column: left-right, up-down, and both diagonals all pass through the center.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-sm leading-relaxed" style={{ color: 'var(--bd-ink-soft)' }}>
            Your first disc should almost always go in column 4. If you play second and your opponent takes the center, play column 3 or 5 — never let them build freely from the middle.
          </p>
          <GuideChecklist verdict items={[
            { mark: 'yes', text: 'First move: always column 4 (center)' },

          <p className="mb-4 text-sm leading-relaxed" style={{ color: 'var(--bd-ink-soft)' }}>
            A double threat means you have two different places where dropping one more disc would win the game. Your opponent can only block one space per turn — so you win the other.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-sm leading-relaxed" style={{ color: 'var(--bd-ink-soft)' }}>
            Setting up a double threat takes a few moves to build. The idea is to work on two different lines at the same time, so your opponent cannot block both.

              tip: 'Check diagonals every turn',
